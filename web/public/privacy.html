      <h1>TuneTrix Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: 11 October 2025</p>

      <p>
        TuneTrix (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This policy explains the limited way we handle
        information for the TuneTrix website, desktop app, and mobile app.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect account details, analytics, tracking information, or persistent identifiers. The only user
        data we receive is the audio content that you explicitly upload while using the TuneTrix tools.
      </p>

      <h2>How uploads are used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Uploaded stems are processed temporarily to let you audition gating, pitch, and mixing behaviour.</li>
        <li>Files are stored only long enough for the session in which you upload them and are not shared with third
          parties.</li>
        <li>You remain the owner of all content you upload.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Uploads are automatically discarded once your session ends or after processing completes. We do not archive,
        back up, or otherwise retain your files beyond that window.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use modern transport security (HTTPS) and limit access to the processing pipeline to protect uploaded media.
        No additional personally identifying information is captured.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        TuneTrix is not directed at children under 13. If you believe a child has provided uploads, please contact us
        so we can delete the material promptly.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Questions about this policy can be sent to
        <a href="mailto:privacy@tunetrix.app">privacy@tunetrix.app</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise this policy to reflect new functionality. Material changes will be posted at this location, and
        the “Effective date” above will identify the latest version.
